==================

X.org/XF86 input driver: virtual tablet (controlled by network)

*Caution: This project is a proof-of-concept yet. Code quality is not
mature, there are no security features etc.*


What does it do?
================

xf86-networktablet is an input driver for Xorg that creates a virtual tablet.
The tablet can be controlled via UDP so that every network application can
simulate movements and button clicks.

The virtual tablet has 3 axes (x, y, pressure) and 1 button.


Installation
============

Tested with Ubuntu 11.10 and 12.10 (64-bit) and Arch (64-bit)

* Install dependencies (X.org development files)
* Adapt Makefile to your paths
* Adapt networktablet.c to your needs. At the moment, there is a hardcoded tablet resolution of 1280x800.
* make
* sudo make install
* Add the input device to xorg.conf. Minimal configuration:
``` 
    Section "ServerLayout"
        Identifier     "DefaultLayout"
        InputDevice    "NetworkTablet0"
    EndSection
    
    Section "InputDevice"
        Identifier     "NetworkTablet0"
        Driver         "networktablet"
    EndSection
``` 
* Restart X server. The X.org logs should show the networktablet device. `xinput list`
  should show the network tablet device.


Usage
=====

Once the driver is running, it *listens on 0.0.0.0:40117 for UDP packets*.
Any application in the network can send UDP packets to this port and control
the virtual tablet.

The structure of the packets is defined in `protocol.h`.

This input driver is used by the XorgTablet android application which enables
you to use any Android device (especially these with stylus pen) as
an X.org graphics tablet for absolute or relative input.
